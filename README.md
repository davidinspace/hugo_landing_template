# Landing Template

A generic [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) landing page based on the [Prologue](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/prologue/) theme, to quickly tests ideas.

- All titles, description, footer, form prefix... are in the config
- Integrates the [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/) forms for subscription and contact.
- Uses layouts/index.html and perso.css
- Removes the gallery.
